# Simple Counter App

A simple and responsive JavaScript Counter App. Use the "+" and "−" buttons to increment and decrement a counter with clean visual styling for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Increment and Decrement Buttons:**  
  Click "+" to increase the counter or "−" to decrease it.
- **Central Counter Display:**  
  Shows the current value in the center of the page.  
  The initial value is set to `0`.
- **Limits and Wrapping:**  
  The counter ranges from 0 to 1000.  
  Clicking "+" at 1000 wraps the counter back to 0, and clicking "−" at 0 wraps it back to 1000.
- **Modern Responsive UI:**  
  Styled with CSS Flexbox for beautiful centering and accessibility on all devices.
