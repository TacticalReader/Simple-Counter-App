# JavaScript Counter App

## Overview

This is a simple JavaScript Counter App that allows users to interactively increment and decrement a counter within specified limits. The app features a visually pleasing and responsive user interface created using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Features

### Increment and Decrement Buttons:

- The app provides two buttons labeled "+" and "-".
- Clicking the "+" button increments the displayed counter value by 1.
- Clicking the "-" button decrements the displayed counter value by 1.

### Counter Display:

- The counter value is displayed in the center of the webpage.
- The initial value is set to 0.

### Limits:

- The counter has limits to prevent it from going below 0 or exceeding 1000.
- If the counter reaches 1000 and the "+" button is clicked, the counter resets to 0.
- If the counter is at 0 and the "-" button is clicked, the counter wraps around to 1000.

## User Interface (CSS Styling)

### Overall Layout:

- The webpage is styled to have a centered layout with a background color.

### Counter Container:

- The counter is contained within a flexbox container, making it horizontally centered.
- Padding and margin are applied for better spacing.

### Counter Display (Span):

- The counter display is styled with a specific font size, background color, padding, and border-radius.
- The color is adjusted to white for better visibility against the background.

### Buttons:

- Both buttons have a larger font size for easy clicking.
- They are styled with a transparent background, and there is no visible border.

### Background:

- The overall background color of the webpage has a semi-transparent blue shade.
